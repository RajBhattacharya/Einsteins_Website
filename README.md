Albert Einstein's Portfolio Website


I have tried to understand the requirements for the assignment and break it down into sections as written below :-


I. The First Sales Pitch.

Q1. How would you describe the website and web application to Mr. Einstein?  (10 Points) [You should write in the TEXT Editor]

Sir you have travelled from the 1950s to here now in 2023. The world like you knew it has moved on. The world has upgraded itself by using the things you loved most, i.e., Science and Technology. Science and Technology became the major tools at our disposal to make life easy and enjoyable.

Amongst numerous technological achievements the most important one that surrounds every aspect of nearly all human life on Earth now is the Internet. During your time the computers were a conceptual thing, then they were realized in the form of big one or two room machines. As days passed, they were reduced in size to fit the human desktop and finally the human laptop followed by the palm of a human hand as mobile phones.

The computers are a wonderful invention. They can make human life easy, do many of our daily jobs, do a part of our thinking work too. But the most dominating part of the functions which a computer can perform is communication. It can communicate one to one or one to many or many to one, it powered by the Internet can let us interact by mails, posts, ads, websites, etc.

Along with the computers, after your time, databases were developed. Databases are nothing but systematically stored information for later use and shared use. The databases at first were small being used by one or two people with the help of computers, then they got little bigger and were used by many people with computers inside an organization. Then they were made far bigger and many such networks of databases throughout the world were connected to create the World Wide Web or the Internet.

Now, the Internet helps us to communicate and receive information with the click of the keyboard and the mouse.

The website is one of the most prolific tools of communication over the Internet. The website is kind of an establishment, a presence on the Internet of an individual or a group or an organization. It can relay information, receive communication, create awareness, promote ideas and create trust about the person or people creating it.

One can sell products or services or simply showcase one’s achievements on a website. Nowadays a lot of global education initiatives and research collaborations are happening through websites. The websites work on desktops, laptops and mobile phones. But for mobile phones (for quick access and ease of access) sometimes an app or application is created.

A website can work very well for a researcher and educator like you.



II. The Website Description.

“I want the website to be elegant and beautiful with subtle colors. I love the image with my tongue outside and want it to be displayed on the website. Can you also please add some good things about me? I heard something about Wikipedia. I also heard that it is very essential to add the papers published by me. Is it true?  Ooo oo, can you add my hobbies too? How about the image collection that I have? I also want to write an article; I think the term is blog these days. Can you please add that too? “

IV. The Website (First Iteration).
“Sorry, I can’t provide you with much content for the website, can you please revise it? All I want right now is my image, and papers published by me.

(ii) The website should be expandable.
